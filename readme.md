# Spyke â€” An interactive neuron modelling tool

Spyke is an interactive web tool for modelling neurons, recording and plotting results.

The package is written to be run as a django web app and is written in Python and Javascript.

The python makes use of the Yale NEURON project as a backend.

The site is hosted [here](https://camrobjones.com/spyke).

Features
--------

- Customize neuron biophysics, including length, diameter, leak channels and HH dynamics.
- Add clamp stimuli to simulations to explore responses from neurons.
- Set simulation parameters including time and membrane potential.
- Run simulations asynchronously in the browser.
- Plot voltage, current, and action potentials.
- Drag and drop neurons on a scalable, pannable 2d map.

Update: 20th Apr 2020

- More compact design of config options

Update: 4th May 2020

- Multiple ion channels
    - Choose from a selection of ion channels for each section
- New Visualizations
    - Visualize ion currents and concentrations
    - Visualise voltage of all sections in separate traces

    - Select multiple sections or segments at once
    - Create parent-child relationships between segments

- Duplicate Neurons
    - Also found in the config menu
    - Add a copy of the neuron to the simulation

- Neuron colors
    - Neurons now have settable colors which show up in the overview and the monitor
    - Select the color swatch on a neuron's config menu item to change its color

- Monitor options
    - Click on the cog at the right hand side of the monitor bar to access
    - Select neuron segments to show/hide them in the monitor traces
    - Optionally lock and set axes

- Tutorials
    - Interactive tutorial
    - Indicates components needed to complete steps
    - Checks steps have been completed before advancing
    - Tracks progress
